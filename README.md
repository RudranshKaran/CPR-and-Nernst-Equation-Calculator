# CPR and Nernst Equation Calculator
A Python-based calculator designed to perform computations for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) metrics and the Nernst equation. This tool is helpful forstudents, researchers, and professionals in fields like biochemistry, physiology, and medical sciences.

## üìú Description
The CPR and Nernst Equation Calculator offers a streamlined way to compute:
- CPR Metrics: Input your parameters, and the tool returns values related to CPR.
- Nernst Equation Values: Calculates the electrochemical potential across a membrane based on ion concentrations, using the Nernst equation.

With this calculator, performing these complex calculations is simple and error-free, reducing the need for manual calculations.

## üöÄ Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple input prompts for quick calculations.
- Accurate Calculations: Reliable results based on user-provided parameters.
- Dual Functionality: Supports both CPR and Nernst equation calculations in a single script.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage
 1.  Run the script in a Python environment:
     ```python Source_Code.py```
 2. Follow the prompts:
    - CPR Calculations: Enter the required metrics as prompted.
    - Nernst Equation: Provide ion concentrations and other parameters as required.
 3. View the calculated results displayed on the console.
